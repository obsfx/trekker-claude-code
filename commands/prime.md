description: Load trekker workflow context

Load the trekker workflow context and command reference.

**IMPORTANT**: `/trekker:prime` is a skill (invoke via Skill tool), NOT a bash command.

Run: `trekker --toon quickstart`

This command reminds you of:
- Essential trekker commands
- Workflow rules (set status, add comments)
- Status values and priority scale
